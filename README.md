# Diabetes Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using various health-related parameters. The models created for this project can achieve a high prediction accuracy and help identify significant factors influencing diabetes.

## Uses:

1. **Predict the likelihood of diabetes** with high accuracy.
2. **Identify key factors** that have a major impact on diabetes prediction.
3. **Aid in early diagnosis** and management of diabetes through predictive analytics.

## Procedure:

### 1. Data Preprocessing, EDA, and Data Engineering

#### Libraries used:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### 2. Model Building

#### Libraries used:
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

### 3. Challenges (Multicollinearity & Heteroscedasticity)

#### Libraries used:
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn

### 4. Feature Selection and Overfitting

#### Libraries used:
- Scikit-learn
- Mlxtend
- Statsmodels

### 5. Determine the Best Model

#### Libraries used:
- Pycaret
- XGBoost

## Results:

1. **Training accuracy:** 97% (Coefficient of Determination)
2. **Testing accuracy:** 94% (Coefficient of Determination)
